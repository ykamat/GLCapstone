# Great Learning Capstone - README

This repository contains my work for my capstone project at Great Learning's PGP Data Science & Engineering program. More information about the same can be found here: https://www.greatlearning.in/pg-program-data-science-course

The project was based on a dataset about diabetes patients in the United States. The dataset had a detailed account of their demographic features (age-group, race, gender) and their medication history. The objective of the project was to predict the likelihood of whether a patient with diabetes to get readmitted into a medical facility within 30 month of their initial admission. More information on the dataset can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008

The **main** project files are:
1) Project_Section_1 - Consists of data preprocessing tasks and exploratory data analysis.
2) Project_Section_2 - Consists of detailed Feature Engineering, Significance Testing, Feature Importance, Clustering and Finalization of Dataset for model building.
3) Project_Section_3 - Consists of all machine learning models built: Gaussian Naive-Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest. This includes their base, hypertuned and boosted models. The inter-model comparison plots are also included in this part.

The other files: (PCA not being included in detail in project due to its very low performance and non-analytical approach)
1) PCA(dummies)
2) PCA(labelencoding)

A final report was written for this study, which includes further analysis, business insights and recommendations to potential stakeholders. Here is the link to the report: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QLqVDjjJ6Wu5YmvRqCv_DJL_UpMRYo69/view

Thank you!
